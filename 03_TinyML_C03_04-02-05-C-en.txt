All right.
And so the next thing that we'll need to do is to install all of the libraries
that we'll be using in this course.
We'll use the Arduino IDE's built in library manager to do this.
You can find that under the Tools menu by clicking Manage Libraries.
This operates very similar to the boards manager that we just used.
And we'll have a similar popup that shows up
in the middle of the screen with a search bar across the top.
So for example, in that search bar, we could type TensorFlow.
And the first thing that will show up is the Arduino TensorFlow Lite Library
for Microcontrollers.
And so we can then go over here and find the correct version.
Again, please check the reading for the most up to date version.
At the time of this recording, it is 2.4.0-alpha.
However, it may change over time.
So again, please check the reading below for the correct version.
Anyway, once you have the correct version, you can click Install.
And it will install the library across the bottom
with another one of those blue bars.
And this should be pretty quick in this case.
Yeah.
It's done.
And when it's done, you'll see the installed word in teal
next to the library.
So please look to the reading below and make
sure you install all of the libraries that we'll need for this course
and install the correct version of those libraries.
Thanks.
