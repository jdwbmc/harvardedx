BRIAN PLANCHER: Let's now take a look at the code behind the Blink example.
If you look, it's actually mostly a comment.
So let's up that text size and just scroll down to the bottom here.
And what we'll find is that the Arduino Blink example is pretty much just two
very short functions--
the setup function and the loop function.
And it turns out that any Arduino sketch boils down to a setup and a loop,
whether it's the simple Blink example or a full keyword spotting application.
In the setup function, we, well, set things up.
You can imagine in a keyword spotting application, that
could be as complicated as turning on the microphone
and initializing a neural network.
Here, it's as simple as just telling the device that we're
going to use the LED is an output.
And then in the loop function, we're going
to run whatever we need to run over and over and over again.
So in the keyword spotting example, that's
recording audio, doing pre-processing, passing it through the neural network,
getting the output, and then doing whatever
we want to do with that output.
In this case, it's just turning the LED on, waiting a second,
and then turning it off.
And in general, it's just to remember that every Arduino sketch is
going to do some amount of setup, and then it's
going to do something in a loop as fast as it can over and over again.
And so you just need to get into a mindset
of that's how your code will work.
It's set something up once, and then infinite loop forever.
So hopefully, that explains the code a little bit.
And I'll see you all in the next test.
