BRIAN PLANCER: Hi, I'm Brian Plancher, and I'm
a PhD candidate at Harvard University.
And I'll be here to help you through the lab components of this course.
We've prepared detailed readings with lots of screenshots and short video
walk-throughs to help make sure you are all set to deploy your TinyML
applications onto your Arduinos.
In this first lab section, we're going to make sure all of your software
gets installed and all of your hardware gets assembled and set up correctly.
Then we'll run a series of test programs to make sure that you are all
set for the rest of this course.
Because TensorFlow Lite for microcontrollers,
and Arduino code in general, is written in C++,
we'll start with a quick introduction to C++ for Python programmers.
Let's dive in.
