VIJAY JANAPA REDDI: Hi.
In this video, I want to talk to you a little bit about how
course 3 is structured, because course 3 is
different from course 1 and course 2 in that we actually
have a hands-on component.
Now, some parts are going to stay the same.
For example, I'm going to continue giving you
video lectures in order to help you realize the important concepts that you
have to keep in mind.
Then you're going to have readings.
Now you have certainly had many readings through both course 1 and course 2.
One of the interesting things that we're doing in course 3
is that we're going to Mbed a couple of [INAUDIBLE] and videos
in order to spruce up the content in order
to help you navigate the programming experience and the development
side of the experience a bit more smoothly.
And then finally, you're going to have labs.
Now these labs will require you to actually do the deployment cycle.
Now, in doing deployment, you might run into a couple of issues.
For example, in the Magic Wand, I ask you to move the device.
Well, it sounds simple, but it might not be that easy
for you to understand exactly what I'm asking you to do.
Therefore, I've asked Brian, my TA, to actually join us in helping us out.
He's going to be doing hands-on demonstrations,
walking you through the colabs, the compilation process,
as well as the deployment process, all the way from getting started
and making sure your kit works to actually seeing TinyML in action.
In addition to that, you're going to have
quizzes, your tests, your assignments, and your discussion forums.
My hope is that all of this material, put together,
will help you have a great experience with the TinyML kit
as well as building the actual applications that go onto this device.
With that said, I'm going to leave you in the good hands of Brian, who's
going to introduce himself next and help you get started with the TinyML kit.
