BRIAN PLANCHER: Hi, everyone.
In this reading, we're going to get your software all set up for this course.
We're going to be working with the Arduino Integrated Development
Environment or IDE for short.
The Arduino IDE has a ton of built-in functionality,
and we'll be using a lot of it in this course.
For example, will be loading in libraries, writing code,
deploying code, monitoring output over the serial port,
and a host of other things.
By the end of this reading, your software
will be all ready to deploy some TinyML applications onto your Arduino.
Now before we dive in, I do want to note that I
will be using the latest versions of all libraries, board files,
et cetera in this reading.
However, I do imagine that over time those versions may become out of date.
We'll make sure to update the reading with the appropriate versions
that you should be using.
However, I am not sure that will be able to update the videos.
So please, please, please use whatever version is written in the reading,
and use that version when you are installing the various libraries.
Thank you.
